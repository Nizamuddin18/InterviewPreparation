<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This Project conatins important Codes that I attempted from Websites like GeeksForGeeks,LeetCode,PepCoding,InterviewBit.

<!--
Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
